        My name is Nicole Apsche, and I live in West Philadelphia. I moved to Philadelphia in 2012 to
        attend Temple Univeristy, where I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Neuroscience in 2016. I found 
        neuroscience really interesting, but I loved my bartending job more. I had worked in restaurants
        growing up, and worked in them all through college. I fell in love with working as a team with my 
        coworkers, and learned many valuable life skills, like organization, customer service, and how to 
        make a perfect margarita. I also got 
        to meet people from all walks of life, which I loved. I worked really hard and was able to pay off my 
        student loans. I loved my time at Copabanana, but it was time to expand my horizons and find a sustainable 
        career.  
      </p>

      <p class="item">
        I began working as a full cycle recruiter for KGTiger, a talent acquisition company based out of Bala 
        Cynwyd, PA. Shortly after, I was promoted to Account Executive, and tasked with the responsibility of
        managing several different accounts for the company, as well as a team of recruiters. I really enjoyed
        getting to work in a wide range of industries, as well as using the technologies I was learning to 
        help others. I soaked up a lot of leadership idealogies from the 
        President, Rasagna Holt. She taught me a lot about business, and also sparked my interest in coding.  I enrolled 
        into the Full Stack Certification Course at the University of Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, I was recently 
        displaced due to COVID, but it gave me an opportunity to really focus and pour all of my energy into 
        learning how to code. Before starting this course, I did not even own a computer. I am really proud of myself 
        for how far I have come in the past 24 weeks. I really believe that my teamwork and leadership skills
        will be an asset to any team. I am excited to continue learning more programming languages and to begin my 
        career as a developer. 
      </p>

      <p class="item" id="last">
        In my spare time, you can find me running at the art museum, snuggled up watching movies, traveling, and 
        spending time with friends. In the future, I would like to read some of the books that I have 
        collected through the years. I look forward to finding a position where I can utilize my skills and 
        really contribute to a team. I look forward to growing my skillset, and would like to find a company
        where I can stay and grow with.
